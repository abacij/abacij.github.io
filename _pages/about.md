Hi! I am a psychology research coordinator at Rutgers University, working in Dr. Shana Cole's Regulation, Action, and Motivated Perception (RAMP) lab. I am currently applying to PhD programs in psychology to further investigate the social and cognitive processes that influence identity, belief systems, and collective action, specifically regarding information processing within social networks. Recently, I've been investigating how ideological threat biases visual perception (e.g., exaggerating or minimizing threatening visual stimuli) in ways that influence collective action participation. I am also interested in exploring the ways social and political identification, as well as collective action, can be leveraged as coping mechanisms, and how these forms of coping may influence negative health outcomes under specific conditions.

Although my work is primarily informed by social psychology theory, I often incorporate cognitive, clinical, and computational insights to form an interdisciplinary perspective. Through this lens, my goal is to develop a comprehensive understanding of identity and social human behavior, ultimately informing psychological well-being across underserved populations through my research.

Outside of research, I love to read, bake, and explore new coffee shops! Refer to the tabs above to browse my CV, research, and other projects (like philosophy papers)!
