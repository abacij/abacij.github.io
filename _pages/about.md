Hi! My name is Julie. I am a recent graduate from The College of New Jersey and am currently seeking post-baccalaureate research positions before eventually pursuing doctoral studies. My research is focused on the implications of marginalization and adversity on well-being, specifically through the lens of social and political identification.
