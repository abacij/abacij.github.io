Hi! I am currently a research coordinator at Rutgers University, working in Dr. Shana Cole's RAMP lab. I earned my B.A. in psychology from The College of New Jersey with a minor in philosophy. My research broadly focuses on the social-cognitive factors that motivate collective action and the methods of leveraging collective power to drive social change. Recently, I've been investigating how ideological threat biases visual perception (e.g., exaggerating or minimizing threatening visual stimuli) in ways that influence collective action participation. I am currently applying to PhD programs in psychology to further investigate the cognitive and social processes that influence identity, belief systems, and collective action, specifically regarding information processing within social networks. I am also interested in exploring the ways social and political identification, as well as collective action, can be leveraged as coping mechanisms, and how these forms of coping may influence negative health outcomes under specific conditions.

Although my work is primarily informed by social psychology theory, I often incorporate clinical, cognitive, and computational insights to form an interdisciplinary perspective. Through this lens, my goal is to develop a comprehensive understanding of systemic inequity and identity, ultimately informing psychological well-being across underserved populations through my research.

Outside of research, I am an avid reader, baker, and lover of philosophical literature. Refer to the tabs above to browse my CV, research, and other projects (like philosophy papers)!
